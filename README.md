# 🏦 CPP-PROJECT-BANK

## 📘 Overview

**CPP-PROJECT-BANK** is a C++ application developed as a final project for the second semester by:

- **Pratik Dahal** (PUR081BCT050)
- **Rupesh Kumar Thapa** (PUR081BCT064)
- **Pratik Karna** (PUR081BCT052)

The project demonstrates the application of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to simulate a banking system, encompassing functionalities such as account management, transactions, and user authentication.

## 🎯 Objectives

- **OOP Implementation**: Utilize classes, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation to model real-world banking entities.  
- **Modular Design**: Organize code into distinct modules for maintainability and scalability.  
- **User Interaction**: Provide a command-line interface for users to perform banking operations.  

## ⚙️ Features

- **Account Management**: Create, view, and delete user accounts.  
- **Transactions**: Deposit and withdraw funds, view transaction history.  
- **Authentication**: Secure login system for user verification.  
- **Data Persistence**: Store user data in files for session continuity.  

## 🧱 Technical Stack

- **Programming Language**: C++  
- **Key Concepts**: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), File Handling  
- **Development Environment**: Any C++ IDE or compiler
